# Overview
An overview of the Yuba Forest Health Book contents and connected agencies.

## Wildfire Crisis
Living in California means living with fire. The state's vital and vast forested landscapes are fire-adapted. Still, after more than a century of fire suppression and intensifying climate catastrophe, devastating wildfires have become increasingly the norm across the state. According to CAL FIRE, Yuba County has significant wildfire risk, with a large portion of the county classified as a "Very High" fire hazard severity zone alongside "High" and "Moderate" zones, indicating substantial potential for wildfires across the county, particularly in forested eastern areas with steep terrain and fire-prone vegetation.

Fortunately, Yuba County has not experienced devastating fires in recent history. However, the county is sandwiched between massive, catastrophic fires since 2020, including the Camp, North Complex, Caldor, and Dixie fires. Fires within county borders have been relatively small ({numref}`fires`).

Entities within the county—such as the Yuba Water Agency, Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council, and Yuba Resource Conservation District—have been working steadily to increase forest management to reduce fire risk and improve forest health. However, large portions of the county remain untreated, and there are unrealized opportunities to increase collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service, PG&E, and others responsible for large areas. 

Fire does not recognize jurisdictional boundaries, so its impacts in surrounding areas provide an important lesson in working collaboratively and contiguously across landscapes. Continued support, such as ongoing funding and efforts to build robust partnerships to manage forests, is critical.

This book is designed to help illustrate key factors in the county that impact fire risk and opportunities for developing projects and partnerships to address risk. We hope this book can be used to drive conversations, inform project design, and increase understanding of the needs and risks we live with—to inform our decision-making and work together to protect our communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems.

## Chapters
The book contains the following chapters:

1. **Overview**. This chapter introduces the Yuba Forest Health book and an overview of the chapters and agencies involved in forest health in Yuba County and the region.
2. **SWOT**. A strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of the Yuba forest landscape and organizations.
3. **Geospatial**. A geospatial analysis of communities and infrastructure at risk in Yuba County.
4. **Lessons**. The project was designed as a pilot to enhance and accelerate funding and implementation of forest health and related business development projects in Yuba County. The chapter contains an analysis and discussion of lessons learned and suggested next steps from the project.

## Yuba Water Agency
The [Yuba Water Agency](https://www.yubawater.org) is a stand-alone public agency governed by a board of seven elected officials to serve the people of Yuba County. Established by a special act of the California State Legislature in 1959, the agency’s primary missions are flood risk reduction, water supply reliability, fish habitat protection and enhancement, hydroelectric generation, and recreation at New Bullards Bar.

Today, the Yuba Water Agency owns and operates facilities that can store approximately 1 million acre-feet of water and generate more than 400 megawatts of hydropower. The agency releases more than 260,000 acre-feet of water to eight irrigation districts each year, which convey the water to local farmers and ranchers in Yuba County.

The agency has been instrumental in supporting forest health as a funder of the forest management efforts of several organizations, as well as an implementer of projects, and a participant in the North Yuba Forest Partnership, while also supporting [research and analysis](https://srfadacip.com/docs) that examines collaborative finance programs {cite:p}`confibook`.

## Yuba Fire Safe Council
The [Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council](https://yubafiresafe.org/) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) community-based group consisting of concerned citizens, local, state, and federal fire professionals, law enforcement, professional foresters, local timber companies, and resource conservation groups along with county government. The council works with the community to protect property and lives, maintain forest health, and prevent and minimize the impacts of wildfires.

## CAL FIRE
CAL FIRE's [Wood Products and Bioenergy](https://shorturl.at/ZxI2n) program seeks to maintain and enhance the forest-sector workforce and businesses of California to promote healthy, resilient forests throughout the state by supporting through grant funding a diverse set of business development and workforce development projects. Eligible business development projects include facilities, operations, and professional services that support the restoration of healthy, resilient forests by improving the wood products industry. More information on upcoming grant solicitations and past funded projects can be found on the program's website (see link in first sentence of this paragraph).
