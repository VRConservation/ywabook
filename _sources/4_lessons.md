# Takeaways & Next Steps
A discussion of the lessons, challenges, outcomes, and next steps from the Yuba FBA Project

## Takeaways
The Yuba FBA pilot project found that workforce and capacity must be built and supported throughout the county. Organizations such as the Resource Conservation District (RCD), Yuba Watershed Protection & Fire Safe Council (YWPFSC), and Camptonville Community Partnership’s Forest Biomass Business Center are doing critical forest health work. Still, in some cases, local capacity (e.g., licensed timber operators or registered professional foresters) are hired from neighboring regions. Synthesized key lessons from the pilot project were the following:

- **Fire**. Although Yuba County has not experienced severe wildfires in the past few decades, huge fires have occurred on nearly all sides. While this may be due to a combination of luck and predominant vegetation types, it has given organizations and communities in the county time to mitigate fire risk through forest management and planning projects, such as clearing high-priority roadsides and forest thinning. The northeastern portion of the county is a high-probability zone for future wildfires.
- **Capacity**. Unlike neighboring counties, Yuba County’s nonprofit and business capacity in the forest health sector is not high, and project implementers have had to rely on outside capacity to carry out projects.
- **Workforce**. The lower forest health capacity in Yuba County is, in part, due to the need for an increased local workforce.
- **Communities**. Rural communities, especially those in the northeastern portion of the county, are most vulnerable to wildfires due to their remote location, limited access to resources, longer evacuation distances, and possible lack of cell phone signal.
- **Water**. Analysis of water infrastructure at risk showed the upper and lower watersheds at New Bullards Bar have a higher risk than the middle. Riparian areas are generally at high risk due to heavy vegetation growth and post-fire impact, such as hillside erosion due to steep slopes or treatment impacts to listed species. The area to the southeast of Collins Lake is at higher risk, but much surrounding the lake is at low risk. The land surrounding Lake Francis is at low risk, but much of the land to the east of the lake is at high risk. Englebright Dam and surrounding riparian areas are at high risk.
- **Biodiversity**. The analysis found a similar trend of higher suitability moving uphill northeast in the county. In addition to that trend, the index was higher in Texas Hill and south of Camptonville. Further analysis or anecdotal information could uncover the reason why.

## Restoration Economy
Declines in extractive industries such as mining, logging, and cattle grazing in the West have had devastating impacts on rural communities {cite}`davis`, {cite}`formosa`, and {cite}`hibbard`. At the same time, this shift has made way for informal (cannabis) and formal (restoration) economies that have brought new opportunities and funding while restoring ecosystem function {cite}`kelly`. {cite:t}`bendor` found that more people were employed in restoration in the United States than in coal mining, logging, and steel manufacturing. However, benefits of the restoration economy and economic development are often scattered or only developed in places with access to capital or higher capacity nonprofits. How can this development be more equitable, especially in the areas where wildfires threaten economic and ecosystem health?

## Project Impact 
Yuba County has a mix of capacities for managing land and healthy forests across the wildland-urban interface ({numref}`landscape`). The Forest Business Alliance team came together to better understand the conditions and needs of Yuba County’s forested landscapes and forest-focused entities and individuals. We then worked to provide targeted, effective assistance. Through the one-on-one triage and guidance activities of Task 1, we found that some organizations were well-poised to pursue and obtain grant funding and implement projects. In contrast, others simply needed technical assistance to clarify their capacity needs. Our engagement with Yuba County stakeholders and GIS analysis revealed organizational and geographic areas of opportunity for focused next steps.

## Challenges
Although the Yuba region is poised to make significant strides in increasing forest health and coordinating landscape management, the Forest Business Alliance team identified several challenges. For example, multiple potential business owners are interested in developing bioenergy facilities that could provide local options for processing woody biomass from forest management activities. However, many named significant hurdles to fundraising for these expensive operations and working with PG&E to establish them. 

The diversity of land ownership in the region—a mosaic of private, federal, and public—makes it challenging to complete projects across a contiguous landscape. Like water, fire doesn’t care about human-made boundaries, but working across jurisdictions to develop, fundraise for, and implement projects is a significant challenge. 

The Forest Business Alliance Team met with local forestry professionals to discuss Yuba County-specific challenges. These conversations provided helpful insights. For example, one local Registered Professional Forester (RPF) shared that there are few practicing RPFs and few loggers in Yuba County. This means that much of the workforce supporting Yuba watershed forestry projects is outside the county and sometimes travels a long distance to do the work. 

Further, the RPF shared that there is a great need for markets for the products that come off the land. This means that woody biomass (trees, logs, etc.) cut down in forest health thinning projects are often piled and left in the forest, creating fire risk. If they are removed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a local use for the material. Having bioenergy facilities, log markets, and other forest product markets in the watershed would be significantly beneficial.

Staffing forest management projects can also be a challenge in Yuba County. During the summer, there is often high turnover as workers move to prevailing-wage jobs. Many forest operators are not savvy about prevailing wages or have limited experience. 

Prescribed fire is an additional challenge due to the liability risk for private entities. Establishing prescribed fire activities, such as those in neighboring counties like Nevada and Placer, could help address this. Both counties are home to community-based burn cooperatives and have active RCDs that lead to prescribed fire training.

Overall, the need is huge. Yuba County is at very high risk of severe wildfire. And yet, large-scale forest management, encouraging the use of good fire (and implementing that through prescribed burns), and reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire requires major, coordinated efforts and myriad smaller, ongoing activities by various organizations and individuals. Entities such as the Forest Business Alliance and YWPFSC that provide a hub for learning, information-sharing, and technical assistance can play a vital role in tackling these large needs. 

## Key Organizations
The capacity of organizations to meet these challenges is critical to a vibrant local economy and mitigating fire risk. Collaboration across those organizations to address unmet capacity can create a sum greater than the individual parts. Each of the key organizations in the County can think about how to continue building their individual and collective capacity to address challenges and then measure their progress. Key organizations include the following:

**YWPFSC** is an active hub in the community. It supports information-sharing and fire risk reduction for individual homeowners and shared areas, such as roadways. This organization needs and actively pursues grant funding and requires ongoing support to ensure its programs are sustainable. 

**The Yuba Resource Conservation District** has been recently revived and is working hard to gain traction through project identification and development. This organization is in a capacity-building stage of development and is actively pursuing grants. Strong partnerships are critical for the RCD, and collaborative work has been the mainstay of early successes. The Forest Business Alliance worked with the RCD and other entities to help increase understanding of the project environment and different organizations' roles. For example, the Fire Safe Council focuses on home hardening and defensible space within a certain zone around private homes and businesses. Larger entities, such as the Forest Service, are working to maintain forest health on much larger landscapes. An effective role for the RCD could be focusing on private lands beyond the defensible space zone and adjacent to USFS lands or other large parcels. 

The Forest Business Alliance team met multiple times with **Yuba College** to discuss its nascent Watershed and Forestry programs. These programs could be instrumental in expanding the currently sparse Yuba County workforce and fostering long-term partnerships. Yuba College’s vision to create pathways for students to find and participate in forest-related internships is essential for the success of local forestry workforce development, which the Forest Business Alliance worked to support.

We assisted the **Forest Biomass Business Center** with project development and reviewing multiple grant proposals. The biomass facility has been awarded grant funds, including critical support from Yuba Water, for one of the most challenging fundraising phases: early planning and design for facility establishment and construction. The FBBC is now poised to continue successful fundraising.  

Multiple **small business owners** requested Forest Business Alliance assistance in reviewing their forest business-related needs, such as equipment, contacts, and alignment with potential grant programs. 

The Yuba Forest Business Alliance project also increased awareness of big-picture forest health and management resources. We provided a spreadsheet that was updated regularly of forest-focused grant programs. We offered one-on-one review of projects against grant programs to help determine potential fit. We also discussed multi-partner project opportunities and their alignment with various grant programs and ongoing coordination activities, such as the Yuba Forest Network. 

## Next Steps 
We recommend focusing future forest health efforts on workforce development, organizational capacity, and local business development to complement those activities. {cite:t}`davis` recommend working to assess workforce needs and capacity and then developing a monitoring plan to measure workforce development over time. The same authors suggest creating the following for forest practitioners to build over time to accomplish this work:

1. In-depth understanding of business and workforce capacity and likely future trends in restoration spending.
2. A network of partners to better coordinate and leverage the economic benefits of restoration work across whole watersheds and the region.
3. Increased availability and predictability of various work opportunities and funding.
4. Federal, state, and watershed council contracts that are structured in size and scope to fit local contracting capacity.
5. Support for local contractors to consistently connect to and capture these jobs.
6. Systems for tracking and sharing these impacts.

These steps and others could be incorporated into a Regional Forest and Fire Capacity Plan, which could be developed collaboratively with the YWPFSC, Yuba Water, and the Yuba RCD.

Additional long- and short-term approaches, roles, and next steps are outlined in the following categories:

**Partnerships**. An important element or role that Yuba Water Agency can play through its Integrated Regional Water Management activities or support of YWPFSC and RCD could be capacity-building to foster durable partnerships that help ensure on-the-ground, collaborative work is completed. This work must include various land ownership types and be informed by data and knowledge of fire risk and forest health needs. Working with the community college and organizations such as the Camptonville Community Partnership can help ensure that locals complete the forest management work. Registered professional foresters are a gap that could be partially aided through the community college acting as a feeder to university programs with accreditation or providing the pathway to become an RPF.

**Gaining momentum**. RCD capacity, YWPFSC continued projects and connecting public/private lands.  Long and short-term. Community of practice between private LTOs, nonprofits, and Yuba Water. Institute knowledge-sharing beyond forest-focused entities. Yuba County is home to important agricultural entities–could forest-focused entities learn from ag producers?

**Treatment areas**. Treat high-priority WUI areas, examine areas that have not burned, and treat key areas that may threaten vulnerable communities in the northwestern portion of the County.
**Community**. Community education and incentives are critical to wildfire-ready communities. The YWPFSCl is conducting significant work related to community areas of focus. For example, the update of the Community Wildfire Protection Plan and ongoing YWPFSC programs are supporting:
-   Addressing vegetation density and evacuation needs. Interagency response to roadside clearing, water, electrical, and other critical infrastructure is essential for egress. Focus on private property is necessary for defensible space and fuel breaks.
- Emergency preparedness and response in most at-risk communities, e.g., Brownsville, Dobbins, and Camptonville.
-  Education and awareness about evacuation plans and routes. Further measures for roadside clearing may also support emergency evacuation and engagement. 
- Focused assistance programs for home hardening, defensible space, fuel breaks, and emergency planning focused toward Dobbins and Oregon House’s aged populations.
- Additional financial assistance programs for private property clearing in lower-income households in communities such as Brownsville, Camptonville, Challenge, Clipper Mills, and Strawberry Valley.

Funding support for these critical areas of focus is the key for YWPFSC. 

Further areas of focus may be:
- Creative programming such as large green waste, large item haul programs, or localized grant programs for communities are incentives modeled by neighboring counties.
- Focused treatment in riparian areas on the Yuba River between New Bullards Bar and Englebright Dam may reduce wildfire impacts and further impacts to water infrastructure and systems.
- Focused education and outreach to landowners by tax address in the northeast part of the county may reach the highest proportion of second homeowners, seasonal residents, or absentee landowners.
- Interagency focus on lands with water infrastructure, particularly federal and federal-adjacent lands, which are at the highest risk of wildfire.

**Capacity & workforce**. Building capacity and the workforce for forest health projects is one of the biggest opportunities in the county. YWPFSC has started down this road, and the RCD is just beginning. Support to build these organizations and others is warranted. Looking for ways to learn from and build on Camptonville Community Partnership’s biomass facility efforts (Forest Biomass Business Center), perhaps expanding the work to other county areas could be another venue to strengthen and build capacity. Finally, private forest businesses, RPFs, and LTOs could be expanded or trained throughout the county. As we understand it, many projects depend on outside capacity and organizations to complete forest health projects. Bringing that work to businesses within the county, e.g., increasing the number of local hires, would be fantastic. 

Increased county capacity for vegetation treatment and wood processing can be reached through both short and long-term strategies:

Short term:
- Localized, community workforce development that has equipment or training to create defensible space
- An additional chipper program or crew based in the county or at the Yuba County RCD to augment efforts by YWPFSC.
- Local contracting through the County or RCD with small, private businesses.
- Develop small, private business opportunities with the Sierra Business Council training for forest workers.
- Workshop on contracting with the County, RCD, or YWPFSC.

Long term:
- Work with and through Yuba College for forestry-related jobs.
- Prioritize hiring and capacity building at the local level.

**Funding**. YWPFSC has been consistently successful in garnering grant funding. The Yuba RCD has pursued several opportunities in partnership with other organizations, although their capacity to pursue larger or many grants is limited until they can take on more staff. Funding pots could be greatly increased in the region by teaming across organizations within the County and neighboring counties. Collaborative efforts such as the Healthy Eldorado Landscape Partnership and the North Yuba Forest Partnership have successfully raised more funds as a unified effort rather than individual organizations.

Since Yuba Water already participates in the Yuba Forest Resilience Bond, it is worth developing and pursuing similar collaborative finance opportunities that can leverage private and public funding for forest health and water infrastructure projects. It’s unclear what these could be, but replicating the North Yuba Forest Bond or diversifying funding portfolios with private investment or foundation grants could increase the county's project and organizational capacity.

**Data**. As the Geospatial Analysis chapter mentions, more forest-health-specific data would be useful for future projects. A final vegetation map, such as those developed in Marin and Sonoma Counties, utilizing Lidar and satellite imagery could be an excellent baseline for a more detailed analysis of the state of Yuba’s forests and provide evidence for the impact of treatments on the future state of forests in the region. Lidar data is now available for the entire Sierra as of 2025 and might make the analysis more financially feasible. 

Key items include the following:
- Additional research or ground truthing for vegetation, treatment, and landownership risks.
- Additional analysis on electrical infrastructure and communication towers.

Addressing forest health and wildfire risk in Yuba County will require a multifaceted approach that combines short- and long-term strategies, community engagement, and interagency collaboration. Key priorities include treating high-risk WUI areas, enhancing community education and incentives, and building local capacity for forest management through partnerships with organizations like the Yuba Water Agency, YWPFSC, and RCD. Expanding workforce development programs, leveraging collaborative funding opportunities, and improving data collection through tools like Lidar and satellite imagery will further strengthen the county’s ability to mitigate wildfire risks and protect vulnerable communities. By fostering durable partnerships, investing in local capacity, and prioritizing data-driven decision-making, Yuba County can build a more resilient landscape and ensure the safety of its residents and critical infrastructure.

**Biodiversity**. Many organizations are beginning to examine the impacts of forest health projects on biodiversity, water, or species. The species impact map in the geospatial chapter could be deepened and used for planning, engaging partners, and as one metric to measure project impacts on the landscape. Similar approaches could be taken for economic and local business development. Measuring biodiversity impacts could be undertaken by the RCD or one of the local land trusts.
