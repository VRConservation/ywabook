# SWOT
A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of the capacity of Yuba County organizations to manage the local forest landscape.

## Takeaways
Key takeaways from the SWOT survey were the following:
- More funding and even more communication are needed to address landscape-level issues.
- Incentives, understanding, and funding support are critical to engaging private landowners.
- Large landscape management is overwhelming, and many of the most engaged entities struggle to address it. An interagency, coordinated approach is imperative.
- Respondents identified key players essential to coordinated action included Yuba County, Yuba Fire Safe Council, Yuba Watershed Agency, Yuba County RCD, US Forest Service, Pacific Gas & Electric, Yuba College, Forest Business Biomass Center, and Private land owners.

## Background
The need for coordinated, large-scale land management in Yuba County’s forested foothills and upper watershed region has gained attention and momentum recently, as catastrophic wildfires are an increasingly urgent issue. The Yuba FBA developed a survey to explore and analyze the conditions, organizations, and characteristics that shape the Yuba landscape and its management. We used the SWOT approach to understand better and communicate the forest management-related strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats in Yuba County. 
 In October 2024, we introduced the survey via email at a Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council meeting and distributed an online survey. We received responses from community members, US Forest Service staff, Yuba County Office of Emergency Services staff, Fire Safe Council staff, a Yuba County representative, and others. Although the analysis would benefit from deeper engagement across a more diverse group, it is a solid starting place for understanding forest management capacity within the region.

## Strengths
Community members who responded to the SWOT survey shared appreciation toward the Fire Safe Council, CAL FIRE’s level of community engagement, and the volunteer fire stations. Emergency response time and interagency collaboration were positive. They noted growing awareness of fire-related issues and actions full-time residents took to reduce wildfire risk. While each area was identified as strengths, respondents indicated that more work should be done to reduce wildfire risk, collaborate, and improve emergency response.
Areas of Focus:
- In the upper foothills region of Yuba County, full-time residents and homeowners are actively engaged in fire prevention planning (e.g., home hardening and property management).
- The Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council is an important hub for multiple communities and forest management activities.

## Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
The Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats have been grouped to highlight focus areas. Results were grouped into three categories: 1) Treatment and Thinning, 2) Leadership, and 3) Workforce and  Wood Processing.

### Treatment and  Thinning
The need for additional acres treated on private property and along roadways was identified as a threat, weakness, and opportunity. Community members called out specific challenges and barriers, including affordability and access to vegetation thinning, landowners' inability to front the costs, landowner education and resistance, and a perceived threat of absentee landowner inaction. A second priority was improving ingress and egress safety through thinning and road widening.
Areas of focus:
- Develop a local workforce for fuel reduction
- Incentivizing thinning
- Increasing outreach, education, and engagement with absentee and resistant landownersEnforce existing clearance and setback requirements for roadways
- More funding and even more communication are needed to address landscape-level issues

### Leadership
Respondents called out broader political and social threats to wildfire prevention at the federal, state, and local levels. Political advocacy for more spending from federal and state partners in rural areas on wildfire prevention was an opportunity. Local-level opportunities included increasing interagency collaboration to address landscape-scale projects and emergency response. A threat was a perceived disconnect between local representatives and landowners, which caused landowners in high-risk areas to feel alienated and under-prioritized.
Areas of Focus:
Intra-agency coordination is relatively limited in Yuba County despite some groups, such as the Fire Safe Council and the Integrated Regional Water Management Planning (IRWMP) group, consistently working to foster collaboration.
- A more coordinated approach involving the Forest Service, PG&E, Fire Safe Council, CAL FIRE, community groups, and entities such as the RCD would be beneficial
- County-led study in areas lacking cell service and install early warning sirens in the foothills

### Workforce and Wood Processing
Workforce and wood processing were highlighted as weaknesses and opportunities. Respondents shared perspectives that the local workforce needs to be increased for thinning. Diversifying treatment and wood processing through mobile sawmills and continued support for the Camptonville Community Partnership’s Forest Biomass Business Center (a bioenergy and wood products campus) was seen as an opportunity. An additional opportunity was continued treatment diversification through establishing a prescribed burn program like those in neighboring Placer and Butte Counties.
Areas of Focus:
- Camptonville Community Partnership’s biomass facility, Forest Business Biomass Center, could be a significant recipient of woody biomass over time.
- Increase the capacity of the Yuba County RCD as a potential hub to diversify local treatment options for private property.
Like other forested communities, the upper watershed of Yuba County is working to address issues caused by untreated, overgrown forest conditions. Respondents shared a sense of urgency and fear about catastrophic wildfires that could devastate their communities. The Camp Fire in Paradise was mentioned several times. While currently in a mode of urgent, proactive preparation before a massive fire erupts in Yuba County, some respondents focused on the long-term maintenance and ongoing work needed to prepare for fire effectively. Suggestions to build and sustain a localized workforce, prescribed burning as maintenance, and building local infrastructure were highlighted as part of the long-term management planning needs.
