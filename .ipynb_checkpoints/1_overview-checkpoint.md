# Overview
An overview of the Yuba Forest Health Book contents and connected agencies.

## Wildfire Crisis
Most forested California is threatened by wildfire due to more than a century of fire suppression. Fires have become increasingly intense over time, exacerbated by climate change. Fortunately, Yuba County has not experienced devastating fires in recent history, such as the Caldor Fire to the south and the Dixie Fire to the north. Yuba County has been sandwiched between catastrophic fires since 2020, including Camp, North Complex, Caldor, and Dixie, where as fires within its borders have been relatively small ({numref}`fires`).

The County has a good head start on forest treatments, often funded by the Yuba Water Agency and implemented by the Yuba Firesafe Council. However, as shown in the geospatial chapter, risks are high, and threats to communities and water infrastructure still exist despite these efforts. Hopefully, continued funding and efforts mitigate these risks and the catastrophic fires in surrounding regions do not come to bear in Yuba County.


## Chapters
The book contains the following chapters:

1. **Overview**. This chapter. Overviewsof  the Yuba Forest Health book chapters and agencies involved in Forest Health in Yuba County and the region.

## Yuba Water Agency
The [Yuba Water Agency](https://www.yubawater.org) is a stand-alone public agency governed by a board of seven elected officials to serve the people of Yuba County. Established by a special act of the California State Legislature in 1959, the agencyâ€™s primary missions are flood risk reduction, water supply reliability, fish habitat protection and enhancement, hydroelectric generation, and recreation at New Bullards Bar.

Today, Yuba Water Agency owns and operates facilities that can store approximately one million acre-feet of water and generate more than 400 megawatts of hydropower. Each year, the Agency releases more than 260,000 acre-feet of water to eight irrigation districts, which convey the water to local farmers and ranchers in Yuba County.

The Agency has been instrumental in supporting conservation finance programs to support Forest Health as a funder and participant in the North Yuba Forest Partnership and supporting [research and analysis](https://srfadacip.com/docs) examining into collaborative finance programs {cite:p}`confibook`.

## Yuba Firesafe Council
The [Yuba Watershed Protection and Fire Safe Council](https://yubafiresafe.org/) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) community-based group consisting of concerned citizens, local, state, and federal fire professionals, law enforcement, professional foresters, local timber companies, and resource conservation groups along with county government. The Council works with the community to protect property and lives, maintain forest health, and prevent and minimize the impacts of wildfires.

## CAL FIRE
CAL FIRE's [Wood Products and Bioenergy](https://shorturl.at/ZxI2n) team seeks to maintain and enhance the forest-sector workforce and businesses of California to promote healthy, resilient forests throughout the state by supporting a diverse set of business development and workforce development projects. Eligible business development projects include facilities, operations, and professional services that support the restoration of healthy, resilient forests by improving the wood products industry. More information on upcoming grant solicitations and past funded projects can be found on the program's website.
